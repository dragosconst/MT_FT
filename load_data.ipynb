The redesign of the $100 note issued in October 2013 took about 14 years.\\n\\nBarbara Ortiz Howard, the founder of Women On 20s, said her organization is fine with a woman on $10 rather than $20 notes.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, is backing Perkins.\\n\\n\"Frances Perkins was the labor secretary at a time when the Department of Labor was incredibly active,\" Wolfers said. \"She helped establish unemployment benefits, the minimum wage, the adoption of the 40-hour work week, and a range of worker protections that make up our modern safety net.\"\\n\\nFormer Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Chafee, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, is backing Rachel Carson. Her 1962 book \"Silent Spring\" is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement.\\n\\n## More Currency Facelifts To Come\\n\\nThe $10 bill was chosen for the new image because it was designated by a special committee that fights illegal printing of money – or counterfeiting — as the next currency note to be redesigned. The committee, which includes representatives from the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the Secret Service and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, focuses on security features that can be used to discourage counterfeiting.\\n\\nLew said that $10 note will be the first in the new series of redesigned notes, all including images on the theme of democracy.\\n\\nThe last changes of portraits on U.S. currency were between 1914 and 1928, when four adjustments were made. Alexander Hamilton, the first Treasury secretary, replaced President Andrew Jackson on the $10 bill. Jackson\\'s image moved to the $20 bill, replacing President Grover Cleveland, who was put on the $1,000 bill. President William McKinley replaced John Marshall on the $500 bill.\\n\\nLew has said that Hamilton\\'s image will remain part of the new $10 bill. The last woman to appear on U.S. paper currency was Martha Washington in the late 19th century. </s>'\n"
